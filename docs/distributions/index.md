# Linux Distributions

This section contains notes on the different Linux distributions I use regularly.

## Arch-based Distributions

[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) is known for its simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality, and versatility. Arch-based distributions build upon this foundation while adding their own features and tools.

- [**EndeavourOS**](arch-based/endeavoros/index.md): A rolling release distro based on Arch Linux that aims to be lightweight and easy to use while staying close to pure Arch.

## Debian-based Distributions

[Debian](https://www.debian.org/) is known for its stability, extensive software repositories, and commitment to free software principles. Many popular distributions are based on Debian.

- [**Ubuntu**](debian-based/ubuntu/index.md): One of the most popular Linux distributions, known for its ease of use and regular release schedule.
- [**Xubuntu**](debian-based/xubuntu/index.md): Ubuntu with the lightweight XFCE desktop environment.
- [**Pop!_OS**](debian-based/pop-os/index.md): System76's Ubuntu-based distribution focused on creators and makers.

## Common Topics

These topics apply across different distributions:

- [**Package Management Comparison**](common/package-management-comparison.md): How package management works across different distributions.
- [**Desktop Environments**](common/desktop-environments.md): Overview of different desktop environments available on Linux.
- [**Terminal Essentials**](common/terminal-essentials.md): Terminal tools and configurations that work across distributions.
