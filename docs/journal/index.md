### 2024-05-01: Getting Started with MkDocs

Today I set up MkDocs for my Linux Hacker Notes site. The process was straightforward:

1. Created the basic directory structure
2. Set up the configuration file
3. Added GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
4. Started adding content to the site

I'm excited to see how this site evolves as I continue learning about Linux.
