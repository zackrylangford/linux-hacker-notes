# Linux Hacker Notes

This site serves as a knowledge base for my journey through different Linux distributions, command-line tools, and system administration techniques.

## What's Inside

This site is organized to help me quickly find information about:

- **Different Linux Distributions** I use daily (EndeavourOS, Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Pop!_OS)
- **Common Tasks** across distributions (updates, backups, customization)
- **Reference Materials** (commands, config files, cheatsheets)
- **My Learning Journal** documenting progress and discoveries
